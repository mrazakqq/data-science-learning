    "The purpose of a hypothesis test is to determine whether the null hypothesis is likely to be true given sample data. Once you have the null and alternative hypothesis in hand, you choose a significance level (often denoted by the Greek letter Î±.). The significance level is a probability threshold that determines when you reject the null hypothesis. After carrying out a test, if the probability of getting a result as extreme as the one you observe due to chance is lower than the significance level, you reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. This probability of seeing a result as extreme or more extreme than the one observed is known as the p-value."
